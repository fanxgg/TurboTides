      <description>&lt;p&gt;The adjustable nozzle ring is an essential component in a radial turbine. It directs the high-temperature, high-pressure airflow from the upstream components into the impeller at a specific angle, imparting a certain circumferential velocity to the impeller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the incoming flow consists of high-temperature, high-pressure gas, and the fluid medium may be somewhat corrosive, the adjustable nozzle ring must resist high temperature, corrosion, and strength. Common materials include stainless steel (SS304, 303, 316, 316L), silicon carbide, and ceramics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
