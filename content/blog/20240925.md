{{< about-text-container >}}
Focusing on the modeling, simulation, and optimization of complex thermo-fluid network systems. It is capable of performing steady-state and transient analyses of fluid flow, temperature, pressure, and composition, as well as simulating fluid-structure interaction and heat transfer phenomena. The software is applicable to various industries, including nuclear power, energy, chemical engineering, aviation, aerospace, shipping, and automotive. It aims to break through the technological blockade imposed by Western countries and provide strong support for high-end manufacturing.
