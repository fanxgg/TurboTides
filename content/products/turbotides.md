## Product Features {style="font-size: 1.5rem;"}
With the support of its self-developed database and using geometric modeling as the core, TurboTides integrates various functional modules, including system cycle analysis, one-dimensional streamline design analysis, two-dimensional flow path calculation, three-dimensional CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) computation, three-dimensional FEA (Finite Element Analysis), fatigue life assessment, crack propagation analysis, and rotor dynamics analysis. These modules enable seamless and automatic data transfer between them and can all be connected to an optimizer for automatic optimization of design solutions.
